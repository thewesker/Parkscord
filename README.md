# Parkscord
Discord bot to display Theme Park queue times.
# Installation
You will need Node.js version 16.5.0 or higher installed. I also assume you have git installed.

Create a discord bot and add it to your server.

`git clone https://github.com/thewesker/Parkscord`

`cd Parkscord`

`npm install`

Edit config_sample.json, providing your own bot token. Change the channel name (without the #) to the channel you'd like the bot to work in. You may also edit the prefix if you wish. When saving, change the filename to `config.json`.

`npm start`
